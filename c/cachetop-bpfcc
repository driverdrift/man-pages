cachetop(8)                 System Manager's Manual                cachetop(8)

NAME
       cachetop  -  Statistics  for  linux  page  cache  hit/miss  ratios  per
       processes. Uses Linux eBPF/bcc.

SYNOPSIS
       cachetop [-p PID] [interval]

DESCRIPTION
       This traces four kernel functions and  prints  per-processes  summaries
       every interval seconds. This can be useful for processes workload char‐
       acterization, and looking for patterns in operation usage over time. It
       provides a top-like interface which by default sorts by HITS in ascend‐
       ing order.

       This  works  by tracing kernel page cache functions using dynamic trac‐
       ing, and will need updating to match any changes  to  these  functions.
       Edit the script to customize which functions are traced.

       Since this uses BPF, only the root user can use this tool.

OPTIONS
       -p PID Trace this PID only.

KEYBINDINGS
       The  following  keybindings  can  be  used to control the output of ca‐
       chetop.

       <      Use the previous column for sorting.

       >      Use the next column for sorting.

       r      Toggle sorting order (default ascending).

       q      Quit cachetop.

REQUIREMENTS
       CONFIG_BPF and bcc.

EXAMPLES
       Update summaries every five second:
              # cachetop

       Print summaries each second:
              # cachetop 1

FIELDS
       PID    Process ID of the process causing the cache activity.

       UID    User ID of the process causing the cache activity.

       CMD    Name of the process.

       HITS   Number of page cache hits.

       MISSES Number of page cache misses.

       DIRTIES
              Number of dirty pages added to the page cache.

       READ_HIT%
              Read hit percent of page cache usage.

       WRITE_HIT%
              Write hit percent of page cache usage.

       BUFFERS_MB
              Buffers size taken from /proc/meminfo.

       CACHED_MB
              Cached  amount  of  data  in  current  page  cache  taken   from
              /proc/meminfo.

OVERHEAD
       This traces various kernel page cache functions and maintains in-kernel
       counts,  which  are asynchronously copied to user-space. While the rate
       of operations can be very high (>1G/sec) we can have up  to  34%  over‐
       head,  this  is still a relatively efficient way to trace these events,
       and so the overhead is expected to be small for normal workloads.  Mea‐
       sure in a test environment.
