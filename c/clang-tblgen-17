NAME
       clang-tblgen - Description to C++ Code for Clang

SYNOPSIS
       clang-tblgen [options] [filename]

DESCRIPTION
       clang-tblgen  is  a program that translates compiler-related target de‐
       scription (.td) files into C++ code  and  other  output  formats.  Most
       users  of  LLVM  will not need to use this program. It is used only for
       writing parts of the compiler.

       Please see tblgen - Description to C++ Code for a  description  of  the
       filename  argument  and  options,  including  the options common to all
       *-tblgen programs.
