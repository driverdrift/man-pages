COREDUMPCTL(1)                    coredumpctl                   COREDUMPCTL(1)

NAME
       coredumpctl - Retrieve and process saved core dumps and metadata

SYNOPSIS

       coredumpctl [OPTIONS...] {COMMAND} [PID|COMM|EXE|MATCH...]

DESCRIPTION
       coredumpctl is a tool that can be used to retrieve and process core
       dumps and metadata which were saved by systemd-coredump(8).

COMMANDS
       The following commands are understood:

       list
           List core dumps captured in the journal matching specified
           characteristics. If no command is specified, this is the implied
           default.

           The output is designed to be human readable and contains a table
           with the following columns:

           TIME
               The timestamp of the crash, as reported by the kernel.

               Added in version 233.

           PID
               The identifier of the process that crashed.

               Added in version 233.

           UID, GID
               The user and group identifiers of the process that crashed.

               Added in version 233.

           SIGNAL
               The signal that caused the process to crash, when applicable.

               Added in version 233.

           COREFILE
               Information whether the coredump was stored, and whether it is
               still accessible: "none" means the core was not stored, "-"
               means that it was not available (for example because the
               process was not terminated by a signal), "present" means that
               the core file is accessible by the current user, "journal"
               means that the core was stored in the "journal", "truncated" is
               the same as one of the previous two, but the core was too large
               and was not stored in its entirety, "error" means that the core
               file cannot be accessed, most likely because of insufficient
               permissions, and "missing" means that the core was stored in a
               file, but this file has since been removed.

               Added in version 233.

           EXE
               The full path to the executable. For backtraces of scripts this
               is the name of the interpreter.

               Added in version 233.

           It's worth noting that different restrictions apply to data saved
           in the journal and core dump files saved in
           /var/lib/systemd/coredump, see overview in systemd-coredump(8).
           Thus it may very well happen that a particular core dump is still
           listed in the journal while its corresponding core dump file has
           already been removed.

           Added in version 215.

       info
           Show detailed information about the last core dump or core dumps
           matching specified characteristics captured in the journal.

           Added in version 215.

       dump
           Extract the last core dump matching specified characteristics. The
           core dump will be written on standard output, unless an output file
           is specified with --output=.

           Added in version 215.

       debug
           Invoke a debugger on the last core dump matching specified
           characteristics. By default, gdb(1) will be used. This may be
           changed using the --debugger= option or the $SYSTEMD_DEBUGGER
           environment variable. Use the --debugger-arguments= option to pass
           extra command line arguments to the debugger.

           Added in version 239.

OPTIONS
       The following options are understood:

       -h, --help
           Print a short help text and exit.

       --version
           Print a short version string and exit.

       --no-pager
           Do not pipe output into a pager.

       --no-legend
           Do not print the legend, i.e. column headers and the footer with
           hints.

       --json=MODE
           Shows output formatted as JSON. Expects one of "short" (for the
           shortest possible output without any redundant whitespace or line
           breaks), "pretty" (for a pretty version of the same, with
           indentation and line breaks) or "off" (to turn off JSON output, the
           default).

       -1
           Show information of the most recent core dump only, instead of
           listing all known core dumps. Equivalent to --reverse -n 1.

           Added in version 215.

       -n INT
           Show at most the specified number of entries. The specified
           parameter must be an integer greater or equal to 1.

           Added in version 248.

       -S, --since
           Only print entries which are since the specified date.

           Added in version 233.

       -U, --until
           Only print entries which are until the specified date.

           Added in version 233.

       -r, --reverse
           Reverse output so that the newest entries are displayed first.

           Added in version 233.

       -F FIELD, --field=FIELD
           Print all possible data values the specified field takes in
           matching core dump entries of the journal.

           Added in version 215.

       -o FILE, --output=FILE
           Write the core to FILE.

           Added in version 215.

       --debugger=DEBUGGER
           Use the given debugger for the debug command. If not given and
           $SYSTEMD_DEBUGGER is unset, then gdb(1) will be used.

           Added in version 239.

       -A ARGS, --debugger-arguments=ARGS
           Pass the given ARGS as extra command line arguments to the
           debugger. Quote as appropriate when ARGS contain whitespace. (See
           Examples.)

           Added in version 248.

       --file=GLOB
           Takes a file glob as an argument. If specified, coredumpctl will
           operate on the specified journal files matching GLOB instead of the
           default runtime and system journal paths. May be specified multiple
           times, in which case files will be suitably interleaved.

           Added in version 246.

       -D DIR, --directory=DIR
           Use the journal files in the specified DIR.

           Added in version 225.

       --root=ROOT
           Use root directory ROOT when searching for coredumps.

           Added in version 252.

       --image=image
           Takes a path to a disk image file or block device node. If
           specified, all operations are applied to file system in the
           indicated disk image. This option is similar to --root=, but
           operates on file systems stored in disk images or block devices.
           The disk image should either contain just a file system or a set of
           file systems within a GPT partition table, following the
           Discoverable Partitions Specification[1]. For further information
           on supported disk images, see systemd-nspawn(1)'s switch of the
           same name.

           Added in version 252.

       --image-policy=policy
           Takes an image policy string as argument, as per systemd.image-
           policy(7). The policy is enforced when operating on the disk image
           specified via --image=, see above. If not specified defaults to the
           "*" policy, i.e. all recognized file systems in the image are used.

       -q, --quiet
           Suppresses informational messages about lack of access to journal
           files and possible in-flight coredumps.

           Added in version 233.

       --all
           Look at all available journal files in /var/log/journal/ (excluding
           journal namespaces) instead of only local ones.

           Added in version 250.

MATCHING
       A match can be:

       PID
           Process ID of the process that dumped core. An integer.

           Added in version 215.

       COMM
           Name of the executable (matches COREDUMP_COMM=). Must not contain
           slashes.

           Added in version 215.

       EXE
           Path to the executable (matches COREDUMP_EXE=). Must contain at
           least one slash.

           Added in version 215.

       MATCH
           General journalctl match filter, must contain an equals sign ("=").
           See journalctl(1).

           Added in version 215.

EXIT STATUS
       On success, 0 is returned; otherwise, a non-zero failure code is
       returned. Not finding any matching core dumps is treated as failure.

ENVIRONMENT
       $SYSTEMD_DEBUGGER
           Use the given debugger for the debug command. See the --debugger=
           option.

           Added in version 239.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1. List all the core dumps of a program

           $ coredumpctl list /usr/lib64/firefox/firefox
           TIME       PID  UID  GID SIG     COREFILE EXE                         SIZE
           Tue ...   8018 1000 1000 SIGSEGV missing  /usr/lib64/firefox/firefox     -
           Wed ... 251609 1000 1000 SIGTRAP missing  /usr/lib64/firefox/firefox     -
           Fri ... 552351 1000 1000 SIGSEGV present  /usr/lib64/firefox/firefox 28.7M

       The journal has three entries pertaining to /usr/lib64/firefox/firefox,
       and only the last entry still has an available core file (in external
       storage on disk).

       Note that coredumpctl needs access to the journal files to retrieve the
       relevant entries from the journal. Thus, an unprivileged user will
       normally only see information about crashing programs of this user.

       Example 2. Invoke gdb on the last core dump

           $ coredumpctl debug

       Example 3. Use gdb to display full register info from the last core
       dump

           $ coredumpctl debug --debugger-arguments="-batch -ex 'info all-registers'"

       Example 4. Show information about a core dump matched by PID

           $ coredumpctl info 6654
                      PID: 6654 (bash)
                      UID: 1000 (user)
                      GID: 1000 (user)
