NAME
       dpkg-buildapi - returns the build API level to use during package build

SYNOPSIS
       dpkg-buildapi [option...] [command]

DESCRIPTION
       dpkg-buildapi is a tool to retrieve the dpkg-build-api(7) level to use
       during build of source Debian packages.

       This program was introduced in dpkg 1.22.0.

COMMANDS
       --help
           Show the usage message and exit.

       --version
           Show the version and exit.

OPTIONS
       -ccontrol-file
           Specifies  the  main  source control file to read information from.
           The default is debian/control.

ENVIRONMENT
       DPKG_BUILD_API
           The build API level to use.  This is intended to be used internally
           by the tools executed from debian/rules to avoid  having  to  parse
           debian/control  multiple times, and not to set the global build API
           level  from  debian/rules,  otherwise  build   drivers   (such   as
           dpkg-buildpackage(1)) cannot access it.

FILES
   Packaging support
       /usr/share/dpkg/buildapi.mk
           Makefile snippet that will parse the build API level.
