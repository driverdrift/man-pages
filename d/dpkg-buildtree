NAME
       dpkg-buildtree - helper for build tree operations during package builds

SYNOPSIS
       dpkg-buildtree [option...] [command]

DESCRIPTION
       dpkg-buildtree is a tool to perform common operations on the build tree
       for a source package.

       This program was introduced in dpkg 1.22.3.

COMMANDS
       clean
           Removes  all artifacts generated during a build by the various dpkg
           tools, and pathnames used or controlled by dpkg tools that are safe
           to clean.  These files are used  to  track  state  between  package
           build  runs,  and are in many cases internal implementation details
           the  packager  should  not  be  concerned  about,  or  are  staging
           directories containing build artifacts.

       --help
           Show the usage message and exit.

       --version
           Show the version and exit.

FILES
   Cleaned files
       debian/files
       debian/files.new
           Files generated by dpkg-distaddfile(1).

       debian/substvars
       debian/substvars.new
           Files generated by dpkg-shlibdeps(1).

       debian/tmp
           Staging  directory containing the contents to be used when creating
           a package.  Both dpkg-gencontrol(1) and dpkg-gensymbols(1) generate

EXAMPLES
   Usage in debian/rules
       You can call dpkg-buildtree clean from the debian/rules  clean  target,
       after having performed other necessary cleanups.

       For example for an autoconf-like build system:

         clean:
               [ ! -f Makefile ] || $(MAKE) distclean
               dpkg-buildtree clean
