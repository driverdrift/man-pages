eatmydata(1)                General Commands Manual               eatmydata(1)

NAME
       eatmydata  -  transparently disable fsync() and other data-to-disk syn‐
       chronization calls

SYNOPSIS
       eatmydata [--] command [ command arguments ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       eatmydata runs a command in the environment where data-to-disk synchro‐
       nization calls (like fsync(), fdatasync(), sync(), msync()  and  open()
       O_SYNC / O_DSYNC flags) have no effect. LD_PRELOAD library libeatmydata
       overrides  respective  C library calls with custom functions that don't
       trigger synchronization but return success nevertheless.

       You may use eatmydata in two ways. In normal mode, just execute  eatmy‐
       data  directly  and pass a command-to-be-run and its arguments via com‐
       mand  line.  In  order  to  use  symlink  mode,  create  a  symlink  to
       /usr/bin/eatmydata  with  the filename (a.k.a basename) of another pro‐
       gram in the PATH and execute eatmydata via that symlink. Then eatmydata
       will find that program in the PATH and run it in the libeatmydata envi‐
       ronment repassing all command line options.

OPTIONS
       Please note that eatmydata does not process any command line options in
       symlink mode. All command line options will be repassed to the underly‐
       ing executable as-is.

       command
              The command to execute. It may be either a full path or the name
              of the command in PATH. In case command cannot be found in PATH,
              eatmydata will fail.

       command arguments
              Arbitrary number of arguments to pass to the command being  exe‐
              cuted.

       --     Optional command separator for compatibility with similar utili‐
              ties. Ignored at the moment.

EXAMPLES
       Given  PATH  is /usr/bin and both /usr/bin/aptitude and /usr/bin/eatmy‐
       data are installed, the following:

           $ ln -s /usr/bin/eatmydata ./aptitude
           $ ./aptitude moo

       is equivalent to:

           $ eatmydata -- aptitude moo

       Therefore, you may use symlink mode to automatically run specific  pro‐
       grams  in the libeatmydata environment whenever you run them from PATH.
       For example, given standard PATH settings, just do:

           # ln -s /usr/bin/eatmydata /usr/local/bin/aptitude

       and enjoy sync-free aptitude system-wide.

CAVEAT
       When using eatmydata with setarch (including alias such as linux32), or
       anyway with chroots with a different  architectures  than  the  host's,
       make sure to install the matching architecture of libeatmydata1 both in
       the setarch environment and host's.

       Trying to load libeatmydata manually (without using the wrapper script)
       and using it through a chroot, especially if the eatmydata version dif‐
       fer  between  outside and inside, is probably going to fail do the dif‐
       ferent position of the library on the file system.
       The safest way to manually load libeatmydata is by setting the  follow‐
       ing two environment variables (shell syntax):

           LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+"$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:"}/usr/lib/libeatmydata
           LD_PRELOAD=${LD_PRELOAD:+"$LD_PRELOAD "}libeatmydata.so

       These  two  variables  accounts the case of a Debian Jessie host with a
       Debian Wheezy chroot, where the position of the library changed.
