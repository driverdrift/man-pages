SYNOPSIS
       llvm-debuginfo-analyzer [options] [filename ...]

DESCRIPTION
       llvm-debuginfo-analyzer parses debug and text sections in binary object
       files and prints their contents in a logical view,  which  is  a  human
       readable representation that closely matches the structure of the orig‐
       inal  user  source  code.  Supported  object  file formats include ELF,
       Mach-O, PDB and COFF.

       The logical view abstracts the complexity associated with the different
       low-level representations of the debugging information that is embedded
       in the object file. llvm-debuginfo-analyzer produces a  canonical  view
       of  the  debug  information regardless of how it is formatted. The same
       logical view will be seen regardless of object  file  format,  assuming
       the  debug  information  correctly  represents the same original source
       code.

       The logical view includes the following logical elements: type,  scope,
       symbol  and  line,  which  are  the basic software elements used in the
       C/C++ programming language. Each logical element has a set  of  attrib‐
       utes,  such  as  types, classes, functions, variables, parameters, etc.
       The --attribute can be used to specify which attributes to include when
       printing a logical element. A logical element may have a kind that  de‐
       scribes  specific types of elements. For instance, a scope could have a
       kind value of function, class, namespace.

       llvm-debuginfo-analyzer defaults to print a pre-defined layout of logi‐
       cal elements and attributes. The command line options can  be  used  to
       control  the  printed  elements  (--print),  using a specific layout (‐
       --report), matching a given pattern (--select, --select-offsets). Also,
       the output can be  limited  to  specified  logical  elements  using  (‐
       --select-lines, --select-scopes, --select-symbols, --select-types).

       llvm-debuginfo-analyzer  can  also  compare  a  set of logical views (‐
       --compare), to find differences and identify possible debug information
       syntax issues (--warning) in any object file.

OPTIONS
       llvm-debuginfo-analyzer options are separated into several  categories,
       each tailored to a different purpose:

          • GENERAL - Standard LLVM options to display help, version, etc.

          • ATTRIBUTES - Describe how to include different details when print‐
            ing an element.

          • PRINT  - Specify which elements will be included when printing the
            view.

          • OUTPUT - Describe the supported formats when printing the view.

          • REPORT - Describe the format layouts for view printing.

          • SELECTION - Allows to use specific criteria or conditions  to  se‐
            lect which elements to print.

          • COMPARE - Compare logical views and print missing and/or added el‐
            ements.

          • WARNING  -  Print the warnings detected during the creation of the
            view.

          • INTERNAL - Internal analysis of the logical view.

   GENERAL
       This section describes the standard help options, used to  display  the
       usage, version, response files, etc.

       -h, --help
              Show help and usage for this command. (--help-hidden for more).

       --help-list
              Show  help  and  usage for this command without grouping the op‐
              tions into categories (--help-list-hidden for more).

       --help-hidden
              Display all available options.

       --print-all-options
              Print all option values after command line parsing.

       --print-options
              Print non-default options after command line parsing

       --version
              Display the version of the tool.

       @<FILE>
              Read command-line options from <FILE>.

       If no input file is specified, llvm-debuginfo-analyzer defaults to read
       a.out and return an error when no input file is found.

       If - is used as the input file, llvm-debuginfo-analyzer reads the input
       from its standard input stream.

   ATTRIBUTES
       The following options enable attributes given for the printed elements.
       The attributes are divided in categories based on the type of data  be‐
       ing  added,  such as: internal offsets in the binary file, location de‐
       scriptors, register names, user source  filenames,  additional  element
       transformations, toolchain name, binary file format, etc.

       --attribute=<value[,value,...]>
              With value being one of the options in the following lists.

                 =all: Include all the below attributes.

              The  following  attributes  describe the most common information
              for a logical element. They help to identify the  lexical  scope
              level;  the  element  visibility across modules (global, local);
              the toolchain name that produced the binary file.

                 =global: Element referenced across Compile Units.
                 =format: Object file format name.
                 =level: Lexical scope level (File=0, Compile Unit=1).
                 =local: Element referenced only in the Compile Unit.
                 =producer: Toolchain identification name.

              The following attributes describe files and directory names from
              the user source code, where the elements  are  declared  or  de‐
              fined;  functions  with  public visibility across modules. These
              options allow to map the elements to their user  code  location,
              for cross references purposes.

                 =directories: Directories referenced in the debug information.
                 =filename: Filename where the element is defined.
                 =files: Files referenced in the debug information.
                 =pathname: Pathname where the object is defined.

              The  following  attributes  describe  additional logical element
              source transformations, in order to display built-in types (int,
              bool, etc.); parameters and arguments used during  template  in‐
              stantiation;  parent  name  hierarchy; array dimensions informa‐
              tion; compiler generated elements and the underlying types asso‐
              ciated with the types aliases.

                 =argument: Template parameters replaced by its arguments.

                 =reference: Element declaration and definition references.
                 =subrange: Subrange encoding information for arrays.
                 =typename: Template parameters.
                 =underlying: Underlying type for type definitions.

              The following attributes describe the debug location information
              for a symbol or scope. It includes the symbol percentage  cover‐
              age  and any gaps within the location layout; ranges determining
              the code sections attached to a function. When  descriptors  are
              used, the target processor registers are displayed.

                 =coverage: Symbol location coverage.
                 =gaps: Missing debug location (gaps).
                 =location: Symbol debug location.

                 =register: Processor register names.

              The  following attributes are associated with low level details,
              such as: offsets in the binary file; discriminators added to the
              lines of inlined functions in order to distinguish specific  in‐
              stances; debug lines state machine registers; elements discarded
              by  the  compiler  (inlining)  or  by  the  linker optimizations
              (dead-stripping); system compile units generated by the MS tool‐
              chain in PDBs.

              PE/COFF file format. It includes MS runtime types.

                 =system: Display PDB's MS system elements.

              The above attributes are grouped into standard and extended cat‐
              egories that can be enabled.

              The  standard  group,  contains those attributes that add suffi‐
              cient information to describe a logical  element  and  that  can
              cover  the  normal  situations while dealing with debug informa‐
              tion.

                 =base
                 =coverage
                 =directories
                 =discriminator
                 =filename
                 =files
                 =format
                 =level
                 =producer
                 =publics
                 =range
                 =reference
                 =zero

              The extended group, contains those  attributes  that  require  a
              more  extended  knowledge  about debug information. They are in‐
              tended when a lower level of detail is required.

                 =argument
                 =discarded
                 =encoded
                 =gaps
                 =generated
                 =global
                 =inserted
                 =linkage
                 =local
                 =location
                 =offset
                 =operation
                 =pathname
                 =qualified
                 =qualifier
                 =register
                 =subrange
                 =system
                 =typename

   PRINT
       The following options describe the elements to print. The  layout  used
       is  determined  by  the  --report. In the tree layout, all the elements
       have their enclosing lexical scopes printed, even when  not  explicitly
       specified.

       --print=<value[,value,...]>
              With value being one of the options in the following lists.

                 =all: Include all the below attributes.

              The  following options print the requested elements; in the case
              of any given select conditions (--select), only  those  elements
              that match them, will be printed. The elements value is a conve‐
              nient  way  to  specify instructions, lines, scopes, symbols and
              types all at once.

                 =elements: Instructions, lines, scopes, symbols and types.
                 =instructions: Assembler instructions for code sections.
                 =lines: Source lines referenced in the debug information.
                 =scopes: Lexical blocks (function, class, namespace, etc).
                 =symbols: Symbols (variable, member, parameter, etc).
                 =types: Types (pointer, reference, type alias, etc).

              The following options print information,  collected  during  the
              creation  of  the  elements, such as: scope contributions to the
              debug information;  summary  of  elements  created,  printed  or
              matched (--select); warnings produced during the view creation.

                 =sizes: Debug Information scopes contributions.
                 =summary: Summary of elements allocated, selected or printed.
                 =warnings: Warnings detected.

              Note: The --print=sizes option is ELF specific.

   OUTPUT
       The following options describe how to control the output generated when
       printing the logical elements.

       --output-file=<path>
              Redirect  the  output  to a file specified by <path>, where - is
              the standard output stream.

       llvm-debuginfo-analyzer has the concept of split view.  When  redirect‐
       ing  the  output from a complex binary format, it is divided into indi‐
       vidual files, each one containing the logical view output for a  single
       compilation unit.

       --output-folder=<name>
              The  folder  to  write  a  file per compilation unit when --out‐
              put=split is specified.

       --output-level=<level>
              Only print elements up to the given lexical level value. The in‐
              put file is at lexical level zero and a compilation unit  is  at
              lexical level one.

       --output=<value[,value,...]>
              With value being one of the options in the following lists.

                 =all: Include all the below outputs.

                 =json: Use JSON as the output format (Not implemented).
                 =split: Split the output by Compile Units.
                 =text: Use a free form text output.

       --output-sort=<key>
              Primary  key  when ordering the elements in the output (default:
              line).  Sorting by logical element kind, requires be familiarity
              with  the  element  kind  selection   options   (--select-lines,
              --select-scopes, --select-symbols, --select-types), as those op‐
              tions describe the different logical element kinds.

                 =kind: Sort by element kind.
                 =line: Sort by element line number.
                 =name: Sort by element name.
                 =offset: Sort by element offset.

   REPORT
       Depending  on the task being executed (print, compare, select), several
       layouts are supported to display the elements in a more  suitable  way,
       to make the output easier to understand.

       --report=<value[,value,...]>
              With value being one of the options in the following list.

                 =all: Include all the below reports.

                 =children: Elements and children are displayed in a tree format.
                 =list: Elements are displayed in a tabular format.
                 =parents: Elements and parents are displayed in a tree format.
                 =view: Elements, parents and children are displayed in a tree format.

       The list layout presents the logical elements in a tabular form without
       any parent-child relationship. This may be the preferred way to display
       elements  that  match specific conditions when comparing logical views,
       making it easier to find differences.

       The children, parents and view layout displays the elements in  a  tree
       format,  with  the scopes representing their nodes, and types, symbols,
       lines and other scopes representing the children. The layout shows  the
       lexical scoping relationship between elements, with the binary file be‐
       ing  the  tree  root  (level 0) and each compilation unit being a child
       (level 1).

       The children layout includes the elements that match any given criteria
       (--select) or (--compare) and its children.

       The parents layout includes the elements that match any given  criteria
       (--select) or (--compare) and its parents.

       The  combined  view  layout  includes the elements that match any given
       criteria (--select) or (--compare), its parents and children.

       Notes:

       1. When a selection criteria (--select) is specified with no report op‐
          tion, the list layout is selected.

       2. The comparison mode always uses the view layout.

   SELECTION
       When printing an element, different data can be included and it  varies
       (--attribute)  from data directly associated with the binary file (off‐
       set) to high level details such as coverage, lexical scope level, loca‐
       tion. As the printed output can reach a considerable size, several  se‐
       lection options, enable printing of specific elements.

       The  pattern  matching can ignore the case (--select-nocase) and be ex‐
       tended to use regular expressions (--select-regex).

   ELEMENTS
       The following options allow printing of elements that match  the  given
       <pattern>, offset <value> or an element <condition>.

       --select=<pattern>
              Print  all  elements whose name or line number matches the given
              <pattern>.

       --select-offsets=<value[,value,...]>
              Print all elements whose offset matches the  given  values.  See
              --attribute option.

       --select-elements=<condition[,condition,...]>
              Print all elements that satisfy the given <condition>. With con‐
              dition being one of the options in the following list.

                 =discarded: Discarded elements by the linker.
                 =global: Element referenced across Compile Units.
                 =optimized: Optimized inlined abstract references.

       --select-nocase
              Pattern matching is case-insensitive when using --select.

       --select-regex
              Treat  any <pattern> strings as regular expressions when select‐
              ing with --select option. If --select-nocase is  specified,  the
              regular expression becomes case-insensitive.

       If  the  <pattern> criteria is too general, a more selective option can
       be specified to target a particular  category  of  elements:  lines  (‐
       --select-lines),  scopes  (--select-scopes), symbols (--select-symbols)
       and types (--select-types).  These options require knowledge of the de‐
       bug information format (DWARF, CodeView, COFF), as the given  kind  de‐
       scribes a very specific type of element.

   LINES
       The  following  options  allow  printing  of lines that match the given
       <kind>.  The given criteria describes the debug line state machine reg‐
       isters.

       --select-lines=<kind[,kind,...]>

   COMPARE
       When  dealing  with  debug  information,  there are situations when the
       printing of the elements is not the correct approach. That is the case,
       when we are interested in the effects caused by different  versions  of
       the same toolchain, or the impact of specific compiler optimizations.

       For  those  cases, we are looking to see which elements have been added
       or removed. Due to the complicated debug information format, it is very
       difficult to use a regular diff tool to find those elements;  even  im‐
       possible when dealing with different debug formats.

       llvm-debuginfo-analyzer supports a logical element comparison, allowing
       to find semantic differences between logical views, produced by differ‐
       ent toolchain versions or even debug information formats.

       When  comparing logical views created from different debug formats, its
       accuracy depends on how close the debug information represents the user
       code. For instance, a logical view created  from  a  binary  file  with
       DWARF  debug  information may include more detailed data than a logical
       view created from a binary file with CodeView/COFF debug information.

       The following options describe the elements to compare.

       --compare=<value[,value,...]>
              With value being one of the options in the following list.

                 =all: Include all the below elements.

                 =lines: Include lines.
                 =scopes: Include scopes.
                 =symbols: Include symbols.
                 =types: Include types.

       llvm-debuginfo-analyzer takes the first binary file on the command line
       as the reference and the second one as the target.  To get a  more  de‐
       scriptive  report, the comparison is done twice. The reference and tar‐
       get views are swapped, in order to produce those missing elements  from
       the target view and those added elements to the reference view.

       See --report options on how to describe the comparison reports.

   WARNING
       When reading the input object files, llvm-debuginfo-analyzer can detect
       issues  in the raw debug information. These may not be considered fatal
       to the purpose of printing a logical view but they can give an  indica‐
       tion about the quality and potentially expose issues with the generated
       debug information.

       The  following  options  describe the warnings to be recorded for later
       printing, if they are requested by --print.

       --warning=<value[,value,...]>
              With value being one of the options in the following list.

                 =all: Include all the below warnings.

              The following options collect additional information during  the
              creation of the logical view, to include invalid coverage values
              and  locations  for symbols; invalid code ranges; lines that are
              zero.

                 =coverages: Invalid symbol coverages values.
                 =lines: Debug lines that are zero.
                 =locations: Invalid symbol locations.
                 =ranges: Invalid code ranges.

   INTERNAL
          For a better understanding of the logical view, access to  more  de‐
          tailed internal information could be needed. Such data would help to
          identify  debug  information  processed or incorrect logical element
          management.  Typically these kind of options are available  only  in
          debug builds.

          llvm-debuginfo-analyzer  supports these advanced options in both re‐
          lease and debug builds, with the exception of the unique ID that  is
          generated only in debug builds.

       --internal=<value[,value,...]>
              With value being one of the options in the following list.

                 =all: Include all the below options.

              The  following options allow to check the integrity of the logi‐
              cal view; collect the debug tags that are processed or  not  im‐
              plemented; ignore the logical element line number, to facilitate
              the  logical  view  comparison  when  using  external comparison
              tools; print the command line options used to invoke llvm-debug‐
              info-analyzer.

                 =id: Print unique element ID.
                 =cmdline: Print command line.
                 =integrity: Check elements integrity.
                 =none: Ignore element line number.
                 =tag: Debug information tags.

              Note: For ELF format, the collected  tags  represent  the  debug
              tags  that are not processed. For PE/COFF format, they represent
              the tags that are processed.

EXAMPLES
       This section includes some  real  binary  files  to  show  how  to  use
       llvm-debuginfo-analyzer  to print a logical view and to diagnose possi‐
       ble debug information issues.

   TEST CASE 1 - GENERAL OPTIONS
       The below example  is  used  to  show  different  output  generated  by
       llvm-debuginfo-analyzer.  We compiled the example for an X86 ELF target
       with Clang (-O0 -g):

          1  using INTPTR = const int *;
          2  int foo(INTPTR ParamPtr, unsigned ParamUnsigned, bool ParamBool) {
          3    if (ParamBool) {
          4      typedef int INTEGER;
          5      const INTEGER CONSTANT = 7;
          6      return CONSTANT;
          7    }
          8    return ParamUnsigned;
          9  }

   PRINTING MODE
       In this mode llvm-debuginfo-analyzer prints the logical  view  or  por‐
       tions of it, based on criteria patterns (including regular expressions)
       to select the kind of logical elements to be included in the output.

   BASIC DETAILS
       The following command prints basic details for all the logical elements
       sorted  by the debug information internal offset; it includes its lexi‐
       cal level and debug info format.

          llvm-debuginfo-analyzer --attribute=level,format
                                  --output-sort=offset
                                  --print=scopes,symbols,types,lines,instructions
                                  test-dwarf-clang.o

       or

          llvm-debuginfo-analyzer --attribute=level,format
                                  --output-sort=offset
                                  --print=elements
                                  test-dwarf-clang.o

       Each row represents an element that is present within the debug  infor‐
       mation.  The  first  column represents the scope level, followed by the
       associated line number (if any), and finally the description of the el‐
       ement.

          Logical View:
          [000]           {File} 'test-dwarf-clang.o' -> elf64-x86-64

          [003]                 {Code} 'andb    $0x1, %al'
          [003]                 {Code} 'movb    %al, -0x15(%rbp)'
          [003]     3           {Line}
          [003]                 {Code} 'testb   $0x1, -0x15(%rbp)'
          [003]                 {Code} 'je      0x13'
          [003]     8           {Line}
          [003]                 {Code} 'movl    %eax, -0x4(%rbp)'
          [003]     9           {Line}
          [003]                 {Code} 'movl    -0x4(%rbp), %eax'
          [003]                 {Code} 'popq    %rbp'
          [003]                 {Code} 'retq'
          [003]     9           {Line}
          [002]     1         {TypeAlias} 'INTPTR' -> '* const int'

       On closer inspection, we can see what could be a potential debug issue:

          [003]                 {Block}
          [003]     4           {TypeAlias} 'INTEGER' -> 'int'

       The 'INTEGER' definition is at level [003], the same lexical  scope  as
       the anonymous {Block} ('true' branch for the 'if' statement) whereas in
       the  original  source code the typedef statement is clearly inside that
       block, so the 'INTEGER' definition should also be at level [004] inside
       the block.

   SELECT LOGICAL ELEMENTS

   COMPARISON MODE
       In this mode llvm-debuginfo-analyzer compares logical views to  produce
       a  report  with the logical elements that are missing or added.  This a
       very powerful aid in finding semantic differences in the debug informa‐
       tion produced by different toolchain versions or even  completely  dif‐
       ferent  toolchains  altogether  (For example a compiler producing DWARF
       can be directly compared against a completely different  compiler  that
       produces CodeView).

       Given  the  previous example we found the above debug information issue
       (related to the previous invalid scope location for  the  'typedef  int
       INTEGER') by comparing against another compiler.

       Using  GCC  to generate test-dwarf-gcc.o, we can apply a selection pat‐
       tern with the printing mode to obtain the following logical  view  out‐
       put.

          llvm-debuginfo-analyzer --attribute=level
                                  --select-regex --select-nocase --select=INTe
                                  --report=list
                                  --print=symbols,types
                                  test-dwarf-clang.o test-dwarf-gcc.o

          Logical View:
          [000]           {File} 'test-dwarf-clang.o'

          [001]           {CompileUnit} 'test.cpp'
          [003]     4     {TypeAlias} 'INTEGER' -> 'int'
          [004]     5     {Variable} 'CONSTANT' -> 'const INTEGER'

          Logical View:
          [000]           {File} 'test-dwarf-gcc.o'

          [001]           {CompileUnit} 'test.cpp'
          [004]     4     {TypeAlias} 'INTEGER' -> 'int'
          [004]     5     {Variable} 'CONSTANT' -> 'const INTEGER'

       The  output  shows that both objects contain the same elements. But the
       'typedef INTEGER' is located at different scope level. The  GCC  gener‐
       ated object, shows '4', which is the correct value.

       Note  that  there  is no requirement that GCC must produce identical or
       similar DWARF to Clang to allow the comparison.  We're  only  comparing
       the  semantics. The same case when comparing CodeView debug information
       generated by MSVC and Clang.

       There are 2 comparison methods: logical view and logical elements.

   LOGICAL VIEW
       It compares the logical view as a whole unit; for a  match,  each  com‐
       pared logical element must have the same parents and children.

       Using  the llvm-debuginfo-analyzer comparison functionality, that issue
       can be seen in a more global context,  that  can  include  the  logical
       view.

       The output shows in view form the missing (-), added (+) elements, giv‐
       ing more context by swapping the reference and target object files.

          llvm-debuginfo-analyzer --attribute=level
                                  --compare=types
                                  --report=view
                                  --print=symbols,types
                                  test-dwarf-clang.o test-dwarf-gcc.o

          Reference: 'test-dwarf-clang.o'
          Target:    'test-dwarf-gcc.o'

          Logical View:
           [000]           {File} 'test-dwarf-clang.o'

           [001]             {CompileUnit} 'test.cpp'
           [002]     1         {TypeAlias} 'INTPTR' -> '* const int'
           [002]     2         {Function} extern not_inlined 'foo' -> 'int'
           [003]                 {Block}
           [004]     5             {Variable} 'CONSTANT' -> 'const INTEGER'
          +[004]     4             {TypeAlias} 'INTEGER' -> 'int'
           [003]     2           {Parameter} 'ParamBool' -> 'bool'
           [003]     2           {Parameter} 'ParamPtr' -> 'INTPTR'
           [003]     2           {Parameter} 'ParamUnsigned' -> 'unsigned int'
          -[003]     4           {TypeAlias} 'INTEGER' -> 'int'

       The  output shows the merging view path (reference and target) with the
       missing and added elements.

   LOGICAL ELEMENTS
       It compares individual logical elements without  considering  if  their
       parents  are  the same. For both comparison methods, the equal criteria
       includes the name, source code location, type, lexical scope level.

   TEST CASE 2 - ASSEMBLER INSTRUCTIONS
       The  below  example  is  used  to  show  different  output generated by
       llvm-debuginfo-analyzer. We compiled the example for  an  X86  Codeview
       and  ELF  targets  with recent versions of Clang, GCC and MSVC (-O0 -g)
       for Windows and Linux.

          1  extern int printf(const char * format, ... );
          2
          3  int main()
          4  {
          5    printf("Hello, World\n");
          6    return 0;
          7  }

       These are the logical views that llvm-debuginfo-analyzer generates  for
       3  different  compilers (MSVC, Clang and GCC), emitting different debug
       information formats (CodeView, DWARF) on Windows and Linux.

       The logical views shows the intermixed  lines  and  assembler  instruc‐
       tions,  allowing  to  compare the code generated by the different tool‐
       chains.

   TEST CASE 3 - INCORRECT LEXICAL SCOPE FOR TYPEDEF
       The below example  is  used  to  show  different  output  generated  by
       llvm-debuginfo-analyzer.  We  compiled  the example for an X86 Codeview
       and ELF targets with recent versions of Clang, GCC and MSVC (-O0 -g).

           1  int bar(float Input) { return (int)Input; }
           2
           3  unsigned foo(char Param) {
           4    typedef int INT;                // ** Definition for INT **
           5    INT Value = Param;
           6    {
           7      typedef float FLOAT;          // ** Definition for FLOAT **
           8      {
           9        FLOAT Added = Value + Param;
          10        Value = bar(Added);
          11      }
          12    }
          13    return Value + Param;
          14  }

       The above test is used to illustrate a scope issue found in  the  Clang
       compiler: PR44884 (Bugs LLVM) / PR44229 (GitHub LLVM)

       The  lines  4  and  7 contains 2 typedefs, defined at different lexical
       scopes.

          4    typedef int INT;
          7      typedef float FLOAT;

       These are the logical views that llvm-debuginfo-analyzer generates  for

       From the previous logical views, we can see  that  the  Clang  compiler
       emits both typedefs at the same lexical scope (3), which is wrong.  GCC
       and MSVC emit correct lexical scope for both typedefs.

       Using  the llvm-debuginfo-analyzer selection facilities, we can produce
       a simple tabular output showing just the logical types that  are  Type‐
       def.

       It  also  shows,  that the CodeView debug information does not generate
       source code line numbers for the those logical types. The logical  view
       is sorted by the types name.

   TEST CASE 4 - MISSING NESTED ENUMERATIONS
       The  below  example  is  used  to  show  different  output generated by
       llvm-debuginfo-analyzer. We compiled the example for  an  X86  Codeview
       and ELF targets with recent versions of Clang, GCC and MSVC (-O0 -g).

           1  struct Struct {
           2    union Union {
           3      enum NestedEnum { RED, BLUE };
           4    };
           5    Union U;
           6  };
           7
           8  Struct S;
           9  int test() {
          10    return S.U.BLUE;
          11  }

       The  above  test is used to illustrate a scope issue found in the Clang
       compiler: PR46466 (Bugs LLVM) / PR45811 (GitHub LLVM)

       These are the logical views that llvm-debuginfo-analyzer generates  for
       3  different  compilers (MSVC, Clang and GCC), emitting different debug
       information formats (CodeView, DWARF) on different platforms.

       generated by Clang and MSVC, they do include such references.

       Types were found in the DWARF debug information generated by Clang.

   TEST CASE 5 - INCORRECT LEXICAL SCOPE FOR VARIABLE
       The  below  example  is  used  to  show  different  output generated by
       llvm-debuginfo-analyzer. We compiled the example for  an  X86  Codeview
       and ELF targets with recent versions of Clang, GCC and MSVC (-O0 -g).

          // definitions.h
          #ifdef _MSC_VER
            #define forceinline __forceinline
          #elif defined(__clang__)
            #if __has_attribute(__always_inline__)
              #define forceinline inline __attribute__((__always_inline__))
            #else
              #define forceinline inline
            #endif
          #elif defined(__GNUC__)
            #define forceinline inline __attribute__((__always_inline__))
          #else
            #define forceinline inline
            #error
          #endif

       As  the  test is dependent on inline compiler options, the above header
       file defines forceinline.

          #include "definitions.h"

           1  #include "definitions.h"
           2  forceinline int InlineFunction(int Param) {
           3    int Var_1 = Param;
           4    {
           5      int Var_2 = Param + Var_1;
           6      Var_1 = Var_2;
           7    }
           8    return Var_1;
           9  }
          10
          11  int test(int Param_1, int Param_2) {
          12    int A = Param_1;
          13    A += InlineFunction(Param_2);
          14    return A;
          15  }

       The above test is used to illustrate a  variable  issue  found  in  the
       Clang compiler: PR43860 (Bugs LLVM) / PR43205 (GitHub)

       These  are the logical views that llvm-debuginfo-analyzer generates for
       3 different compilers (MSVC, Clang and GCC), emitting  different  debug

       From the previous logical views, we can see that the CodeView debug in‐
       formation generated by the Clang compiler shows the variables Var_1 and
       Var_2  are at the same lexical scope (4) in the function InlineFuction.
       The DWARF generated by GCC/Clang and CodeView generated by  MSVC,  show
       those variables at the correct lexical scope: 3 and 4 respectively.

       Using  the llvm-debuginfo-analyzer selection facilities, we can produce
       a simple tabular output showing just the logical elements that have  in
       their name the var pattern. The logical view is sorted by the variables
       name.

       It  also  shows,  that the CodeView debug information does not generate
       source code line numbers for the those  logical  symbols.  The  logical
       view is sorted by the types name.

       The  {Range}  attribute  describe  the line ranges for a logical scope.
       For this case, the function foo is within the lines 2 and 9.

       The {Coverage} and {Location} attributes describe  the  debug  location
       and  coverage  for  logical  symbols.  For optimized code, the coverage
       value decreases and it affects the program debuggability.

EXIT STATUS
       llvm-debuginfo-analyzer returns 0 if the input files  were  parsed  and
       printed successfully. Otherwise, it returns 1.
