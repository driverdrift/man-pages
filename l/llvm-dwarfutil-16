LLVM-DWARFUTIL(1)                    LLVM                    LLVM-DWARFUTIL(1)

NAME
       llvm-dwarfutil - A tool to copy and manipulate debug info

SYNOPSIS
       llvm-dwarfutil [options] input output

DESCRIPTION
       llvm-dwarfutil is a tool to copy and manipulate debug info.

       In basic usage, it makes a semantic copy of the input to the output. If
       any  options  are  specified, the output may be modified along the way,
       e.g.  by removing unused debug info.

       If “-” is specified for the input file, the input is read from the pro‐
       gram’s standard input stream. If “-” is specified for the output  file,
       the output is written to the standard output stream of the program.

       The tool is still in active development.

COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS
       --garbage-collection
              Removes  pieces  of  debug information related to discarded sec‐
              tions.  When the linker  does  section  garbage  collection  the
              abandoned  debug  info is left behind. Such abandoned debug info
              references address ranges using  tombstone  values.  Thus,  when
              this  option  is specified, the tool removes debug info which is
              marked with the tombstone value.

              That option is enabled by default.

       --odr-deduplication
              Remove duplicated types (if “One Definition Rule”  is  supported
              by  source  language).  Keeps  first type definition and removes
              other definitions, potentially significantly reducing  the  size
              of output debug info.

              That option is enabled by default.

       --help, -h
              Print a summary of command line options.

       --no-garbage-collection
              Disable --garbage-collection.

       --no-odr-deduplication
              Disable --odr-deduplication.

       --no-separate-debug-file
              Disable --separate-debug-file.

       --num-threads=<n>, -j
              Specifies  the maximum number (n) of simultaneous threads to use
              for processing.

       --separate-debug-file
              Generate separate  file  containing  output  debug  info.  Using
              llvm-dwarfutil  with  that option equals to the following set of
              commands:

          :program:`llvm-objcopy` --only-keep-debug in-file out-file.debug
          :program:`llvm-objcopy` --strip-debug in-file out-file
          :program:`llvm-objcopy` --add-gnu-debuglink=out-file.debug out-file

       --tombstone=<value>
              <value> can be one of the following values:

                 • bfd: zero for all addresses and  [1,1]  for  DWARF  v4  (or
                   less) address ranges and exec.

                 • maxpc:  -1  for all addresses and -2 for DWARF v4 (or less)
                   address ranges.

                 • universal: both bfd and maxpc.

                 • exec: match with address ranges of executable sections.

                 The value universal is used by default.

       --verbose
              Enable verbose logging. This option disables multi-thread mode.

       --verify
              Run the DWARF verifier on the output DWARF debug info.

       --version
              Print the version of this program.

SUPPORTED FORMATS
       The following formats are currently supported by llvm-dwarfutil:

       ELF

EXIT STATUS
       llvm-dwarfutil exits with a non-zero exit code if there  is  an  error.
       Otherwise, it exits with code 0.
