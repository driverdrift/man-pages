NAME
       llvm-opt-report - generate optimization report from YAML

SYNOPSIS
       llvm-opt-report [options] [input]

DESCRIPTION
       llvm-opt-report  is a tool to generate an optimization report from YAML
       optimization record files.

       You need to create an input YAML optimization record file  before  run‐
       ning llvm-opt-report.

       It  provides information on the execution time, memory usage, and other
       details of each optimization pass.

          $ clang -c foo.c -o foo.o -O3 -fsave-optimization-record

       Then, you create a report using the llvm-opt-report  command  with  the
       YAML optimization record file foo.opt.yaml as input.

          $ llvm-opt-report foo.opt.yaml -o foo.lst

       foo.lst is the generated optimization report.

          < foo.c
           1          | void bar();
           2          | void foo() { bar(); }
           3          |
           4          | void Test(int *res, int *c, int *d, int *p, int n) {
           5          |   int i;
           6          |
           7          | #pragma clang loop vectorize(assume_safety)
           8     V4,1 |   for (i = 0; i < 1600; i++) {
           9          |     res[i] = (p[i] == 0) ? res[i] : res[i] + d[i];
          10          |   }
          11          |
          12  U16     |   for (i = 0; i < 16; i++) {
          13          |     res[i] = (p[i] == 0) ? res[i] : res[i] + d[i];
          14          |   }
          15          |
          16 I        |   foo();
          17          |
          18          |   foo(); bar(); foo();
             I        |   ^
             I        |                 ^
          19          | }
          20          |

       Symbols  printed  on the left side of the program indicate what kind of
       optimization was performed.  The meanings of the symbols  are  as  fol‐
       lows:

       • I: The function is inlined.

       • U:  The  loop  is unrolled. The following number indicates the unroll
         factor.

       • V: The loop is vectorized. The following numbers indicate the  vector
         length and the interleave factor.

       NOTE:
          If  a  specific line of code is output twice, it means that the same
          optimization pass was applied to that line of code  twice,  and  the
          pass was able to further optimize the code on the second iteration.

OPTIONS
       If  input is "-" or omitted, llvm-opt-report reads from standard input.
       Otherwise, it will read from the specified filename.

       If the -o option is omitted, then llvm-opt-report will send its  output
       to  standard  output.   If the -o option specifies "-", then the output
       will also be sent to standard output.

       --help Display available options.

       --version
              Display the version of this program.

       --format=<string>
              The format of the optimization record file.  The Argument is one
              of the following:

              • yaml

              • yaml-strtab

              • bitstream

       --no-demangle
              Do not demangle function names.

       -o=<string>
              Output file.

       -r=<string>
              Root for relative input paths.

       -s     Do not include vectorization factors, etc.

EXIT STATUS
       llvm-opt-report returns 0 on success. Otherwise, an  error  message  is
       printed to standard error, and the tool returns 1.
