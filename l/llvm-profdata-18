MERGE
   SYNOPSIS
       llvm-profdata merge [options] [filename...]

   DESCRIPTION
       llvm-profdata  merge  takes several profile data files generated by PGO
       instrumentation and merges them together into a single indexed  profile
       data file.

       By default profile data is merged without modification. This means that
       the  relative importance of each input file is proportional to the num‐
       ber of samples or counts it contains. In  general,  the  input  from  a
       longer  training  run  will be interpreted as relatively more important
       than a shorter run. Depending on the nature of the training runs it may
       be useful to adjust the weight given to each input file  by  using  the
       -weighted-input option.

       Profiles passed in via -weighted-input, -input-files, or via positional
       arguments are processed once for each time they are seen.

   OPTIONS
       --help Print a summary of command line options.

       --output=<output>, -o
              Specify the output file name.  Output cannot be - as the result‐
              ing indexed profile data can't be written to standard output.

       --weighted-input=<weight,filename>
              Specify  an  input  file  name  along with a weight. The profile
              counts of the supplied filename will be scaled  (multiplied)  by
              the  supplied  weight,  where  weight is a decimal integer >= 1.
              Input files specified without using this option are  assigned  a
              default weight of 1. Examples are shown below.

       --input-files=<path>, -f
              Specify  a file which contains a list of files to merge. The en‐
              tries in this file are newline-separated.  Lines  starting  with
              '#'  are  skipped.  Entries  may  be  of  the form <filename> or
              <weight>,<filename>.

       --remapping-file=<path>, -r
              Specify a file which contains a remapping from symbol  names  in
              the input profile to the symbol names that should be used in the
              output  profile.  The  file  should consist of lines of the form
              <input-symbol> <output-symbol>.  Blank lines and lines  starting
              with # are skipped.

              The  llvm-cxxmap  tool can be used to generate the symbol remap‐
              ping file.

       --instr (default)
              Specify that the input profile is an instrumentation-based  pro‐
              file.

       --sample
              Specify that the input profile is a sample-based profile.

              The  format  of  the  generated  file can be generated in one of
              three ways:

              --binary (default)

              Emit the profile  using  a  binary  encoding.  For  instrumenta‐
              tion-based  profile the output format is the indexed binary for‐
              mat.

              --extbinary

              Emit the profile using an extensible binary encoding.  This  op‐
              tion  can only be used with sample-based profile. The extensible
              binary encoding can be more compact with compression enabled and
              can be loaded faster than the default binary encoding.

              --text

              Emit the profile in text mode. This option can also be used with
              both sample-based and instrumentation-based profile.  When  this
              option  is  used  the  profile will be dumped in the text format
              that is parsable by the profile reader.

              --gcc

              Emit the profile using GCC's gcov format (Not yet supported).

       --sparse[=true|false]
              Do not emit function records with 0 execution count. Can only be
              used in conjunction with -instr. Defaults to false, since it can
              inhibit compiler optimization during PGO.

       --num-threads=<N>, -j
              Use N threads to perform profile merging. When  N=0,  llvm-prof‐
              data  auto-detects an appropriate number of threads to use. This
              is the default.

       --failure-mode=[any|all]
              Set the failure mode. There are two options:  'any'  causes  the
              merge  command  to  fail  if any profiles are invalid, and 'all'
              causes the merge command to fail only if all  profiles  are  in‐
              valid. If 'all' is set, information from any invalid profiles is
              excluded from the final merged product. The default failure mode
              is 'any'.

       --prof-sym-list=<path>
              Specify a file which contains a list of symbols to generate pro‐
              file  symbol  list  in the profile. This option can only be used
              with sample-based profile in extbinary format.  The  entries  in
              this file are newline-separated.

       --compress-all-sections=[true|false]
              Compress  all sections when writing the profile. This option can
              only be used with sample-based profile in extbinary format.

       --use-md5=[true|false]
              Use MD5 to represent string in name table when writing the  pro‐
              file.  This option can only be used with sample-based profile in
              extbinary format.

       --gen-partial-profile=[true|false]
              Mark  the  profile  to  be a partial profile which only provides
              partial profile coverage for the optimized target.  This  option
              can only be used with sample-based profile in extbinary format.

       --convert-sample-profile-layout=[nest|flat]
              Convert  the  merged  profile  into a profile with a new layout.
              Supported layout are nest (Nested profile, the input  should  be
              CS  flat  profile)  and flat (Profile with nested inlinees flat‐
              tened out).

       --supplement-instr-with-sample=<file>
              Supplement an instrumentation profile with sample  profile.  The
              sample  profile  is the input of the flag. Output will be in in‐
              strumentation format (only works with -instr).

       --zero-counter-threshold=<float>
              For the function which is cold in instr profile but hot in  sam‐
              ple profile, if the ratio of the number of zero counters divided
              by the total number of counters is above the threshold, the pro‐
              file  of the function will be regarded as being harmful for per‐
              formance and will be dropped.

       --instr-prof-cold-threshold=<int>
              User specified cold threshold for instr profile which will over‐
              ride the cold threshold got from profile summary.

       --suppl-min-size-threshold=<int>
              If the size of a function is smaller than the threshold,  assume
              it  can  be  inlined by PGO early inliner and it will not be ad‐
              justed based on sample profile.

       --debug-info=<path>
              Specify the executable or .dSYM that contains debug info for the
              raw profile.  When  --debug-info-correlate  or  --profile-corre‐
              late=debug-info was used for instrumentation, use this option to
              correlate the raw profile.

       --binary-file=<path>
              Specify  the  executable  that contains profile data and profile
              name sections for the raw profile.  When  -profile-correlate=bi‐
              nary  was used for instrumentation, use this option to correlate
              the raw profile.

       --temporal-profile-trace-reservoir-size
              The maximum number of temporal profile traces to  be  stored  in
              the output profile. If more traces are added, we will use reser‐
              voir sampling to select which traces to keep. Note that changing
              this  value  between different merge invocations on the same in‐
              dexed profile could result in sample bias. The default value  is
              100.

       --temporal-profile-max-trace-length
              The  maximum  number  of  functions in a single temporal profile
              trace. Longer traces will be truncated.  The  default  value  is
              1000.

       --function=<string>
              Only keep functions matching the regex in the output, all others
              are erased from the profile.

       --no-function=<string>
              Remove  functions  matching  the regex from the profile. If both
              --function  and  --no-function  are  specified  and  a  function
              matches both, it is removed.

   EXAMPLES
   Basic Usage
       Merge three profiles:

          llvm-profdata merge foo.profdata bar.profdata baz.profdata -output merged.profdata

   Weighted Input
       The  input  file  foo.profdata  is  especially  important, multiply its
       counts by 10:

          llvm-profdata merge --weighted-input=10,foo.profdata bar.profdata baz.profdata --output merged.profdata

       Exactly equivalent to the previous invocation  (explicit  form;  useful
       for programmatic invocation):

          llvm-profdata merge --weighted-input=10,foo.profdata --weighted-input=1,bar.profdata --weighted-input=1,baz.profdata --output merged.profdata

SHOW
   SYNOPSIS
       llvm-profdata show [options] [filename]

   DESCRIPTION
       llvm-profdata  show takes a profile data file and displays the informa‐
       tion about the profile counters for this file and for any of the speci‐
       fied function(s).

       If filename is omitted or is -, then llvm-profdata show reads its input
       from standard input.

   OPTIONS
       --all-functions
              Print details for every function.

       --binary-ids
              Print embedded binary ids in a profile.

       --counts
              Print the counter values for the displayed functions.

       --show-format=<text|json|yaml>
              Emit output in the selected format if supported by the  provided
              profile type.

       --function=<string>
              Print details for a function if the function's name contains the
              given string.

       --help Print a summary of command line options.

       --output=<output>, -o
              Specify the output file name.  If output is - or it isn't speci‐
              fied, then the output is sent to standard output.

       --instr (default)
              Specify  that the input profile is an instrumentation-based pro‐
              file.

       --text Instruct the profile dumper to show profile counts in  the  text
              format of the instrumentation-based profile data representation.
              By  default,  the  profile information is dumped in a more human
              readable form (also in text) with annotations.

       --topn=<n>
              Instruct the profile dumper to show the top n functions with the
              hottest basic blocks in the summary  section.  By  default,  the
              topn functions are not dumped.

       --sample
              Specify that the input profile is a sample-based profile.

       --memop-sizes
              Show  the profiled sizes of the memory intrinsic calls for shown
              functions.

       --value-cutoff=<n>
              Show only those functions whose max count values are greater  or
              equal to n.  By default, the value-cutoff is set to 0.

       --list-below-cutoff
              Only  output  names of functions whose max count value are below
              the cutoff value.

       --profile-version
              Print profile version.

       --showcs
              Only show context sensitive profile counts. The  default  is  to
              filter all context sensitive profile counts.

       --show-prof-sym-list=[true|false]
              Show  profile  symbol list if it exists in the profile. This op‐
              tion is only meaningful for sample-based  profile  in  extbinary
              format.

       --show-sec-info-only=[true|false]
              Show  basic  information about each section in the profile. This
              option is only meaningful for sample-based profile in  extbinary
              format.

       --debug-info=<path>
              Specify the executable or .dSYM that contains debug info for the
              raw  profile.   When  --debug-info-correlate or --profile-corre‐
              late=debug-info was used for instrumentation, use this option to
              show the correlated functions from the raw profile.

       --covered
              Show only the functions that have been executed, i.e., functions
              with non-zero counts.

OVERLAP
   SYNOPSIS
       llvm-profdata overlap [options] [base profile file] [test profile file]

   DESCRIPTION
       llvm-profdata overlap takes two profile data  files  and  displays  the
       overlap of counter distribution between the whole files and between any
       of the specified functions.

       In  this  command,  overlap is defined as follows: Suppose base profile
       file has the following counts: {c1_1, c1_2, ..., c1_n, c1_u_1,  c2_u_2,
       ..., c2_u_s}, and test profile file has {c2_1, c2_2, ..., c2_n, c2_v_1,
       c2_v_2,  ..., c2_v_t}.  Here c{1|2}_i (i = 1 .. n) are matched counters
       and c1_u_i (i = 1 .. s) and c2_v_i (i = 1 .. v) are unmatched  counters
       (or counters only existing in) base profile file and test profile file,
       respectively.  Let sum_1 = c1_1 + c1_2 +  ... + c1_n +  c1_u_1 + c2_u_2
       +  ... + c2_u_s, and sum_2 = c2_1 + c2_2 + ... + c2_n + c2_v_1 + c2_v_2
       +  ...   +   c2_v_t.    overlap   =   min(c1_1/sum_1,   c2_1/sum_2)   +
       min(c1_2/sum_1, c2_2/sum_2) + ...  + min(c1_n/sum_1, c2_n/sum_2).

       The  result  overlap  distribution is a percentage number, ranging from
       0.0% to 100.0%, where 0.0% means there is no overlap and 100.0% means a
       perfect overlap.

       Here is an example, if base profile file has counts of {400, 600},  and
       test  profile file has matched counts of {60000, 40000}. The overlap is
       80%.

   OPTIONS
       --function=<string>
              Print details for a function if the function's name contains the
              given string.

       --help Print a summary of command line options.

       --output=<output>, -o
              Specify the output file name.  If output is - or it isn't speci‐
              fied, then the output is sent to standard output.

       --value-cutoff=<n>
              Show only those functions whose max count values are greater  or
              equal  to  n.  By default, the value-cutoff is set to max of un‐
              signed long long.

       --cs   Only show overlap for the context sensitive profile counts.  The
              default is to show non-context sensitive profile counts.

ORDER
   SYNOPSIS
       llvm-profdata order [options] [filename]

   DESCRIPTION
       llvm-profdata  order  uses temporal profiling traces from a profile and
       finds a function order that reduces the number of page faults for those
       traces.  This output can be directly passed to lld via  --symbol-order‐
       ing-file= for ELF or -order-file for Mach-O. If the traces found in the
       profile  are  representative  of the real world, then this order should
       improve startup performance.

   OPTIONS
       --help Print a summary of command line options.

       --output=<output>, -o
              Specify the output file name.  If output is - or it isn't speci‐
              fied, then the output is sent to standard output.

EXIT STATUS
       llvm-profdata returns 1 if the command is omitted or is invalid, if  it
       cannot read input files, or if there is a mismatch between their data.
