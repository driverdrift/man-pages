LLVM-REDUCE(1)                       LLVM                       LLVM-REDUCE(1)

NAME
       llvm-reduce - LLVM automatic testcase reducer.

SYNOPSIS
       llvm-reduce [options] [input…]

DESCRIPTION
       The  llvm-reduce tool project that can be used for reducing the size of
       LLVM test cases.  It works by removing redundant  or  unnecessary  code
       from  LLVM  test  cases  while still preserving their ability to detect
       bugs.

       If input is “-”, llvm-reduce reads from standard input.  Otherwise,  it
       will read from the specified filenames.

       LLVM-Reduce  is  a  useful tool for reducing the size and complexity of
       LLVM test cases, making it easier to identify and debug issues  in  the
       LLVM compiler infrastructure.

GENERIC OPTIONS
       --help Display available options (–help-hidden for more).

       --abort-on-invalid-reduction
              Abort if any reduction results in invalid IR

       --in-place
              WARNING:  This  option will replace your input file with the re‐
              duced version!

       --ir-passes=<string>
              A textual description of  the  pass  pipeline,  same  as  what’s
              passed to opt -passes.

       -j <uint>
              Maximum  number of threads to use to process chunks. Set to 1 to
              disable parallelism.

       --max-pass-iterations=<int>
              Maximum number of times to run the full set of delta passes (de‐
              fault=5).

       --mtriple=<string>
              Set the target triple.

       --preserve-debug-environment
              Don’t disable features used for crash debugging (crash  reports,
              llvm-symbolizer and core dumps)

       --print-delta-passes
              Print list of delta passes, passable to –delta-passes as a comma
              separated liste.

       --skip-delta-passes=<string>
              Delta  passes  to  not run, separated by commas. By default, run
              all delta passes.

       --starting-granularity-level=<uint>
              Number of times to divide chunks prior to first test.

              Note : Granularity refers to the level of detail  at  which  the
              reduction  process operates.  A lower granularity means that the
              reduction process operates at a more coarse-grained level, while
              a  higher  granularity  means  that  it  operates  at   a   more
              fine-grained level.

       --test=<string>
              Name of the interesting-ness test to be run.

       --test-arg=<string>
              Arguments passed onto the interesting-ness test.

       --verbose
              Print extra debugging information.

       --write-tmp-files-as-bitcode
              Always write temporary files as bitcode instead of textual IR.

       -x={ir|mir}
              Input language as ir or mir.

EXIT STATUS
       llvm-reduce  returns  0  under  normal operation. It returns a non-zero
       exit code if there were any errors.
