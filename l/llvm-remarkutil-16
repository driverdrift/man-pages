LLVM-REMARKUTIL(1)                   LLVM                   LLVM-REMARKUTIL(1)

NAME
       llvm-remarkutil - Remark utility

SYNOPSIS
       llvm-remarkutil [subcommmand] [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Utility for displaying information from, and converting between differ‐
       ent remark formats.

SUBCOMMANDS
          • bitstream2yaml - Reserialize bitstream remarks to YAML.

          • yaml2bitstream - Reserialize YAML remarks to bitstream.

          • instruction-count - Output function instruction counts.

   bitstream2yaml
       USAGE: llvm-remarkutil bitstream2yaml <input file> -o <output file>

   Summary
       Takes  a  bitstream remark file as input, and reserializes that file as
       YAML.

   yaml2bitstream
       USAGE: llvm-remarkutil yaml2bitstream <input file> -o <output file>

   Summary
       Takes a YAML remark file as input, and reserializes that  file  in  the
       bitstream format.

   instruction-count
       USAGE:  llvm-remarkutil  instruction-count  <input  file> –parser=<bit‐
       stream|yaml> -o <output file>

   Summary
       Outputs instruction count remarks for every function. Instruction count
       remarks encode the number of instructions in  a  function  at  assembly
       printing time.

       Instruction count remarks require asm-printer remarks.

       CSV format is as follows:

       ::     Function,InstructionCount foo,123
