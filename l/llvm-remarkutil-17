LLVM-REMARKUTIL(1)                   LLVM                   LLVM-REMARKUTIL(1)

NAME
       llvm-remarkutil - Remark utility

SYNOPSIS
       llvm-remarkutil [subcommmand] [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Utility for displaying information from, and converting between differ‐
       ent remark formats.

SUBCOMMANDS
          • bitstream2yaml - Reserialize bitstream remarks to YAML.

          • yaml2bitstream - Reserialize YAML remarks to bitstream.

          • instruction-count - Output function instruction counts.

          • annotation-count  -  Output  remark type count from annotation re‐
            marks.

   bitstream2yaml
       USAGE: llvm-remarkutil bitstream2yaml <input file> -o <output file>

   Summary
       Takes a bitstream remark file as input, and reserializes that  file  as
       YAML.

   yaml2bitstream
       USAGE: llvm-remarkutil yaml2bitstream <input file> -o <output file>

   Summary
       Takes  a  YAML  remark file as input, and reserializes that file in the
       bitstream format.

   instruction-count
       USAGE: llvm-remarkutil  instruction-count  <input  file>  –parser=<bit‐
       stream|yaml> [–use-debug-loc] -o <output file>

   Summary
       Outputs instruction count remarks for every function. Instruction count
       remarks  encode  the  number  of instructions in a function at assembly
       printing time.

       Instruction count remarks require asm-printer remarks.

       CSV format is as follows:

       ::     Function,InstructionCount foo,123

       if –use-debug-loc is passed then the CSV will include the source  path,
       line number and column.

       ::     Source,Function,InstructionCount path:line:column,foo,3

   annotation-count
       USAGE:  llvm-remarkutil  annotation-count  <input  file>  –parser=<bit‐
       stream|yaml> –annotation-type=<type>  [–use-debug-loc] -o <output file>

   Summary
       Outputs a count for annotation-type <type> remark for  every  function.
       The  count  expresses the number of remark checks inserted at the func‐
       tion.

       Annotation count remarks require AnnotationRemarksPass remarks.

       CSV format is as follows:

       ::     Function,Count foo,123

       if –use-debug-loc is passed then the CSV will include the source  path,
       line number and column.

       ::     Source,Function,Count path:line:column,foo,3
