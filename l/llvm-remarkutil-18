NAME
       llvm-remarkutil - Remark utility

SYNOPSIS
       llvm-remarkutil [subcommmand] [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Utility for displaying information from, and converting between differ‐
       ent remark formats.

SUBCOMMANDS
          • bitstream2yaml - Reserialize bitstream remarks to YAML.

          • yaml2bitstream - Reserialize YAML remarks to bitstream.

          • instruction-count - Output function instruction counts.

          • annotation-count  -  Output  remark type count from annotation re‐
            marks.

          • size-diff - Compute diff in size remarks.

   bitstream2yaml
       USAGE: llvm-remarkutil bitstream2yaml <input file> -o <output file>

   Summary
       Takes a bitstream remark file as input, and reserializes that  file  as
       YAML.

   yaml2bitstream
       USAGE: llvm-remarkutil yaml2bitstream <input file> -o <output file>

   Summary
       Takes  a  YAML  remark file as input, and reserializes that file in the
       bitstream format.

   instruction-count
       USAGE: llvm-remarkutil instruction-count  <input  file>  --parser=<bit‐
       stream|yaml> [--use-debug-loc] -o <output file>

   Summary
       Outputs instruction count remarks for every function. Instruction count
       remarks  encode  the  number  of instructions in a function at assembly
       printing time.

       Instruction count remarks require asm-printer remarks.

       CSV format is as follows:

       ::     Function,InstructionCount foo,123

       if --use-debug-loc is passed then the CSV will include the source path,
       line number and column.

       ::     Source,Function,InstructionCount path:line:column,foo,3

   annotation-count
       USAGE: llvm-remarkutil  annotation-count  <input  file>  --parser=<bit‐
       stream|yaml>  --annotation-type=<type>   [--use-debug-loc]  -o  <output
       file>

   Summary
       Outputs a count for annotation-type <type> remark for  every  function.
       The  count  expresses the number of remark checks inserted at the func‐
       tion.

       Annotation count remarks require AnnotationRemarksPass remarks.

       CSV format is as follows:

       ::     Function,Count foo,123

       if --use-debug-loc is passed then the CSV will include the source path,
       line number and column.

       ::     Source,Function,Count path:line:column,foo,3

   count
       ..program:: llvm-remarkutil count

       USAGE: llvm-remarkutil count [options] <input file>

   Summary
       llvm-remarkutil   count   counts   remarks   <https://llvm.org/docs/Re‐
       marks.html>  based on specified properties.  By default the tool counts
       remarks based on how many occur in a source file or function  or  total
       for the generated remark file.  The tool also supports collecting count
       based on specific remark arguments. The specified arguments should have
       an integer value to be able to report a count.

       The  tool contains utilities to filter the remark count based on remark
       name, pass name, argument value and remark type.  OPTIONS -------

       --parser=<yaml|bitstream>
              Select the type of input remark parser. Required.  *  yaml:  The
              tool  will parse YAML remarks.  * bitstream: The tool will parse
              bitstream remarks.

       --count-by<value>

       Select option to collect remarks by.

       * ``remark-name``: count how many individual remarks exist.

       * ``arg``: count remarks based on specified arguments passed by
       --(r)args. The argument value must be a number.

       --group-by=<value>

       group count of remarks by property.

       * ``source``: Count will be collected per source path. Remarks with no
       debug location will not be counted.

       Remarks with no debug location will not be counted.

       * ``Total``: Report a count for the provided remark file.

       --args[=arguments]

       If `count-by` is set to `arg` this flag can be used to collect from
       specified remark arguments represented as a comma separated string.

       The arguments must have a numeral value to be able to count remarks by

       --rargs[=arguments]

       If `count-by` is set to `arg` this flag can be used to collect from
       specified remark arguments using regular expression.

       The arguments must have a numeral value to be able to count remarks by

       --pass-name[=<string>]

       Filter count by pass name.

   size-diff
       USAGE:  llvm-remarkutil  size-diff  [options]  file_a  file_b  --parser
       parser

   Summary
       llvm-remarkutil  size-diff  diffs  size  remarks  in  two remark files:
       file_a and file_b.

       llvm-remarkutil size-diff can be used to gain insight into which  func‐
       tions were impacted the most by code generation changes.

       In  most  common  use-cases file_a and file_b will be remarks output by
       compiling a fixed source with differing compilers  or  differing  opti‐
       mization settings.

       llvm-remarkutil size-diff handles both YAML and bitstream remarks.

OPTIONS
       --parser=<yaml|bitstream>
              Select  the  type of input remark parser. Required.  * yaml: The
              tool will parse YAML remarks.  * bitstream: The tool will  parse
              bitstream remarks.

       --report-style=<human|json>
              Output  style.   * human: Human-readable textual report. Default
              option.  * json: JSON report.

       --pretty
              Pretty-print JSON output. Optional.

              If output is not set to JSON, this does nothing.

       -o=<file>
              Output file for the report. Outputs to stdout by default.

HUMAN-READABLE OUTPUT
       The human-readable format for llvm-remarkutil size-diff is composed  of
       two sections:

       • Per-function changes.

       • A high-level summary of all changes.

   Changed Function Section
       Suppose you are comparing two remark files OLD and NEW.

       For  each  function  with  a  changed instruction count in OLD and NEW,
       llvm-remarkutil size-diff will emit a line like below:

          (++|--|==) (>|<) function_name, N instrs, M stack B

       A breakdown of the format is below:

       (++|--|==)
              Which of OLD and NEW the function_name is present in.

              • ++: Only in NEW. ("Added")

              • --: Only in OLD. ("Removed")

              • ==: In both.

       (>|<)  Denotes if function_name has more instructions or fewer instruc‐
              tions in the second file.

              • >: More instructions in second file than first file.

              • <: Fewer instructions in second file than in first file.

       function_name
              The name of the changed function.

       N instrs
              Second file instruction count - first file instruction count.

       M stack B
              Second file stack byte count - first file stack byte count.

   Summary Section
       llvm-remarkutil size-diff will output a high-level summary after print‐
       ing all changed functions.

          instruction count: N (inst_pct_change%)
          stack byte usage: M (sb_pct_change%)

       N      Sum of all instruction count  changes  between  the  second  and
              first file.

       inst_pct_change%
              Percent  increase  or  decrease in instruction count between the
              second and first file.

       M      Sum of all stack byte count changes between the second and first
              file.

       sb_pct_change%
              Percent increase or decrease in stack  byte  usage  between  the
              second and first file.

JSON OUTPUT
   High-Level view
       Suppose we are comparing two files, OLD and NEW.

       llvm-remarkutil size-diff will output JSON as follows.

          "Files": [
            "A": "path/to/OLD",
            "B": "path/to/NEW"
          ]

          "InBoth": [
            ...
          ],

          "OnlyInA": [
            ...
          ],

          "OnlyInB": [
            ...
          ]

       Files  Original paths to remark files.

              • A: Path to the first file.

              • B: Path to the second file.

       InBoth Functions present in both files.

       OnlyInA
              Functions only present in the first file.

       OnlyInB
              Functions only present in the second file.

   Function JSON
       The  InBoth, OnlyInA, and OnlyInB sections contain size information for
       each function in the input remark files.

          {
            "FunctionName" : "function_name"
            "InstCount": [
                INST_COUNT_A,
                INST_COUNT_B
              ],
            "StackSize": [
                STACK_BYTES_A,
                STACK_BYTES_B
              ],
          }

       FunctionName
              Name of the function.

       InstCount
              Instruction counts for the function.

              • INST_COUNT_A: Instruction count in OLD.

              • INST_COUNT_B: Instruction count in NEW.

       StackSize
              Stack byte counts for the function.

              • STACK_BYTES_A: Stack bytes in OLD.

              • STACK_BYTES_B: Stack bytes in NEW.

   Computing Diffs From Function JSON
       Function JSON does not contain the diffs. Tools consuming  JSON  output
       from  llvm-remarkutil size-diff are responsible for computing the diffs
       separately.

       To compute the diffs:

       • Instruction count diff: INST_COUNT_B - INST_COUNT_A

       • Stack byte count diff: STACK_BYTES_B - STACK_BYTES_A

EXIT STATUS
       llvm-remarkutil size-diff returns 0 on success, and  a  non-zero  value
       otherwise.
