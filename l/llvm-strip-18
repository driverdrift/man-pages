LLVM-STRIP(1)                        LLVM                        LLVM-STRIP(1)

NAME
       llvm-strip - object stripping tool

SYNOPSIS
       llvm-strip [options] inputs...

DESCRIPTION
       llvm-strip  is  a tool to strip sections and symbols from object files.
       If no other stripping or remove options are specified, --strip-all will
       be enabled.

       By default, the input files are modified in-place. If "-" is  specified
       for the input file, the input is read from the program's standard input
       stream.

       If the input is an archive, any requested operations will be applied to
       each archive member individually.

       The tool is still in active development, but in most scenarios it works
       as a drop-in replacement for GNU's strip.

GENERIC AND CROSS-PLATFORM OPTIONS
       The  following options are either agnostic of the file format, or apply
       to multiple file formats.

       --disable-deterministic-archives, -U
              Use real values for UIDs,  GIDs  and  timestamps  when  updating
              archive member headers.

       --discard-all, -x
              Remove  most  local symbols from the output. Different file for‐
              mats may limit this to a subset of the local symbols. For  exam‐
              ple,  file  and  section symbols in ELF objects will not be dis‐
              carded. Additionally, remove all debug sections.

       --enable-deterministic-archives, -D
              Enable deterministic mode when stripping archives,  i.e.  use  0
              for archive member header UIDs, GIDs and timestamp fields. On by
              default.

       --help, -h
              Print a summary of command line options.

       --no-strip-all
              Disable --strip-all.

       -o <file>
              Write  output  to <file>. Multiple input files cannot be used in
              combination with -o.

       --only-keep-debug
              Produce a debug file as the output that only preserves  contents
              of sections useful for debugging purposes.

              For ELF objects, this removes the contents of SHF_ALLOC sections
              that  are  not  SHT_NOTE by making them SHT_NOBITS and shrinking
              the program headers where possible.

       --regex
              If specified,  symbol  and  section  names  specified  by  other
              switches  are  treated as extended POSIX regular expression pat‐
              terns.

       --remove-section <section>, -R
              Remove the specified section from the output. Can  be  specified
              multiple times to remove multiple sections simultaneously.

       --strip-all-gnu
              Remove all symbols, debug sections and relocations from the out‐
              put.  This  option  is  equivalent  to  GNU  strip's --strip-all
              switch.

       --strip-all, -s
              For ELF objects, remove from the output all symbols and  non-al‐
              loc  sections  not  within  segments,  except  for .gnu.warning,
              .ARM.attribute sections and the section name table.

              For COFF objects, remove all symbols, debug sections, and  relo‐
              cations from the output.

       --strip-debug, -d, -g, -S
              Remove all debug sections from the output.

       --strip-symbol <symbol>, -N
              Remove all symbols named <symbol> from the output. Can be speci‐
              fied multiple times to remove multiple symbols.

       --strip-unneeded
              Remove  from  the output all local or undefined symbols that are
              not required by relocations. Also remove all debug sections.

       --version, -V
              Display the version of the llvm-strip executable.

       --wildcard, -w
              Allow wildcard syntax for symbol-related flags.  On  by  default
              for section-related flags. Incompatible with --regex.

              Wildcard syntax allows the following special symbols:
                   ┌────────────────┬─────────────────────┬────────────┐
                   │ Character      │ Meaning             │ Equivalent │
                   ├────────────────┼─────────────────────┼────────────┤
                   │ *              │ Any number of char‐ │ .*         │
                   │                │ acters              │            │
                   ├────────────────┼─────────────────────┼────────────┤
                   │ ?              │ Any  single charac‐ │ .          │
                   │                │ ter                 │            │
                   ├────────────────┼─────────────────────┼────────────┤
                   │ \              │ Escape   the   next │ \          │
                   │                │ character           │            │
                   ├────────────────┼─────────────────────┼────────────┤
                   │ [a-z]          │ Character class     │ [a-z]      │
                   ├────────────────┼─────────────────────┼────────────┤
                   │ [!a-z], [^a-z] │ Negated   character │ [^a-z]     │
                   │                │ class               │            │
                   └────────────────┴─────────────────────┴────────────┘

              Additionally, starting a wildcard with '!' will prevent a match,
              even if another flag matches. For example -w -N '*' -N '!x' will
              strip all symbols except for x.

              The order of wildcards does not matter. For example, -w  -N  '*'
              -N '!x' is the same as -w -N '!x' -N '*'.

       @<FILE>
              Read  command-line  options  and  commands  from  response  file
              <FILE>.

ELF-SPECIFIC OPTIONS
       The following options are implemented only for  ELF  objects.  If  used
       with  other  objects,  llvm-strip will either emit an error or silently
       ignore them.

       --allow-broken-links
              Allow llvm-strip to remove sections even if it would  leave  in‐
              valid section references. Any invalid sh_link fields will be set
              to zero.

       --discard-locals, -X
              Remove local symbols starting with ".L" from the output.

       --keep-file-symbols
              Keep  symbols  of type STT_FILE, even if they would otherwise be
              stripped.

       --keep-section <section>
              When removing sections from the output, do not  remove  sections
              named  <section>. Can be specified multiple times to keep multi‐
              ple sections.

       --keep-symbol <symbol>, -K
              When removing symbols from the output,  do  not  remove  symbols
              named <symbol>. Can be specified multiple times to keep multiple
              symbols.

       --preserve-dates, -p
              Preserve access and modification timestamps in the output.

       --strip-sections
              Remove  from the output all section headers and all section data
              not within segments. Note that many tools will not  be  able  to
              use an object without section headers.

       -T     Remove Swift symbols.

EXIT STATUS
       llvm-strip  exits with a non-zero exit code if there is an error.  Oth‐
       erwise, it exits with code 0.
