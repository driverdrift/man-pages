NAME
       sg_get_elem_status - send SCSI GET PHYSICAL ELEMENT STATUS command

SYNOPSIS
       sg_get_elem_status  [--brief]  [--filter=FLT]  [--help]  [--hex] [--in‐
       hex=FN]   [--maxlen=LEN]   [--raw]   [--readonly]    [--report-type=RT]
       [--starting=ELEM] [--verbose] [--version] DEVICE

DESCRIPTION
       Send  the  SCSI  GET  PHYSICAL ELEMENT STATUS command to the DEVICE and
       output the response. The command was introduced in (draft) SBC-4  revi‐
       sion 16.

       The  default action is to decode the response into one physical element
       status descriptor per line then output a header and the status descrip‐
       tors to stdout.  The amount of output can be reduced by the --brief op‐
       tion.

       Rather than send this SCSI command to DEVICE, if the --inhex=FN  option
       is  given,  then the contents of the file named FN are decoded as ASCII
       hex and then processed if it was the response of this command.

OPTIONS
       Arguments to long options are mandatory for short options as well.

       -b, --brief
              tbd

       -f, --filter=FLT
              where FLT is placed in a two bit field called FILTER in the  GET
              PHYSICAL ELEMENT STATUS command. Only two values are defined for
              that  field:  0 for all element descriptors; 1 for those element
              descriptors that are outside 'spec' or have depopulation  infor‐
              mation to report. In both cases the REPORT TYPE and STARTING EL‐
              EMENT fields may further restrict (reduce) the number of element
              descriptors returned. The default value is zero.

       -h, --help
              output the usage message then exit.

       -H, --hex
              output response to this command in ASCII hex.

       -i, --inhex=FN
              where  FN  is  a  function name whose contents are assumed to be
              ASCII hexadecimal. If DEVICE is also given then  DEVICE  is  ig‐
              nored,  a  warning is issued and the utility continues, decoding
              the file named FN. See the "FORMAT  OF  FILES  CONTAINING  ASCII
              HEX"  section  in the sg3_utils manpage for more information. If
              the --raw option is also given  then  the  contents  of  FN  are
              treated as binary.

       -m, --maxlen=LEN
              where  LEN  is  the  (maximum)  response  length in bytes. It is
              placed in the cdb's "allocation length" field. If not given then
              32 is used. 32 is enough space for  the  response  header  only.
              LEN  should  be  a multiple of 32 (e.g. 32, 64, and 96 are suit‐
              able).

       -r, --raw
              output response in binary (to stdout) unless the --inhex=FN  op‐
              tion is also given. In that case the input file name (FN) is de‐
              coded as binary (and the output is _not_ in binary).

       -R, --readonly
              open the DEVICE read-only (e.g. in Unix with the O_RDONLY flag).
              The default is to open it read-write.

       -t, --report-type=RT
              where  RT  will  be  placed  in the REPORT TYPE field of the GET
              PHYSICAL ELEMENT STATUS command. Currently only two  values  are
              defined:  0 for 'physical element' and 1: for 'storage element'.
              The default value is 1 .

       -s, --starting=ELEM
              where ELEM is the placed in the STARTING ELEMENT  field  of  the
              GET PHYSICAL ELEMENT STATUS command. Only physical elements with
              identifiers  equal to or greater than ELEM are returned. The de‐
              fault value is zero which while it isn't a valid element identi‐
              fier (since they must be non-zero) is given in an example in An‐
              nex L of SBC-4 revision 17. So an ELEM of zero is assumed to  be
              valid in this context.

       -v, --verbose
              increase the level of verbosity, (i.e. debug output). Additional
              output caused by this option is sent to stderr.

       -V, --version
              print the version string and then exit.

EXIT STATUS
       The  exit status of sg_get_elem_status is 0 when it is successful. Oth‐
       erwise see the sg3_utils(8) man page.
