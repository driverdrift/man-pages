NAME
       sg_rdac - display or modify SCSI RDAC Redundant Controller mode page

SYNOPSIS
       sg_rdac [-6] [-a] [-f=LUN] [-v] [-V] DEVICE

DESCRIPTION
       sg_rdac  displays  or modifies the RDAC controller settings via the Re‐
       dundant Controller mode page (0x2C). When modifying the settings it al‐
       lows one to transfer the ownership of individual  drives  to  the  con‐
       troller the command was received on.

OPTIONS
       -6     Use  the 6 byte cdb variants of the SCSI MODE SENSE and MODE SE‐
              LECT commands.  The default action (in the absence of  this  op‐
              tion) is to use the 10 byte cdb variants.

       -a     Transfer all (visible) devices

       -f=LUN Transfer  the  device  identified by LUN. This command will only
              work if the controller supports  'Dual  Active  Mode'  (aka  ac‐
              tive/active  mode).  LUN is a decimal number which cannot exceed
              31 when the -6 option is given, otherwise is cannot exceed 255.

       -v     be verbose

       -V     print version string then exit

EXIT STATUS
       The exit status of sg_rdac is 0 when it is  successful.  Otherwise  see
       the sg3_utils(8) man page.
