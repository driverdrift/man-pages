UBUNTU-PRO(1)                     Ubuntu Pro                     UBUNTU-PRO(1)

NAME
       pro - Manage Ubuntu Pro services from Canonical

SYNOPSIS
       pro [-h] [--debug] [--version] <command> ...

DESCRIPTION
       Ubuntu  Pro  is a collection of services offered by Canonical to Ubuntu
       users. The Ubuntu Pro command line tool is used to attach a  system  to
       an Ubuntu Pro contract to then enable and disable services from Canoni‐
       cal.  The  available commands and services are described in more detail
       below.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Show help for pro or for the specified pro command.

       --debug
              Redirect all the debugging logs to the console.

       --version
              Show the Pro Client version and exit.

COMMANDS
       api [-h] [--show-progress] [--args [OPTIONS ...]] [--data DATA] end‐
       point
              Calls the Client API endpoints.

              For a list of all of the supported endpoints  and  their  struc‐
              ture, please refer to the Pro Client API reference guide:

              https://canonical-ubuntu-pro-client.readthedocs-
              hosted.com/en/latest/references/api/

       attach [-h] [--no-auto-enable] [--attach-config ATTACH_CONFIG] [--for‐
       mat {cli,json}] [token]
              Attach  this  machine to an Ubuntu Pro subscription with a token
              obtained from: https://ubuntu.com/pro/dashboard

              When running this command without a token, it  will  generate  a
              short  code  and prompt you to attach the machine to your Ubuntu
              Pro account using a web browser.

              The "attach-config" option can be used to provide  a  file  with
              the token and optionally, a list of services to enable after at‐
              taching.  To  know  more,  visit:  https://canonical-ubuntu-pro-
              client.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/howtoguides/how_to_at‐
              tach_with_config_file/

              The exit code will be:

                  * 0: on successful attach
                  * 1: in case of any error while trying to attach

              Ubuntu Pro services.

       fix [-h] [--dry-run] [--no-related] security_issue
              Inspect  and resolve Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs)
              and Ubuntu Security Notices (USNs) on this machine.

              The exit code will be:

                  * 0: the fix was successfully applied or the system  is  not
              affected
                  * 1: the fix cannot be applied

       refresh [-h] [{contract,config,messages}]
              Refresh three distinct Ubuntu Pro related artifacts in the  sys‐
              tem:

                  * contract: Update contract details from the server.
                  * config:   Reload the config file.
                  * messages: Update APT and MOTD messages related to Pro.

              You  can  individually target any of the three specific actions,
              by passing the target name to the command. If no target is spec‐
              ified, all targets are refreshed.

       security-status [-h] [--format {json,yaml,text}] [--thirdparty | --un‐
       available | --esm-infra | --esm-apps]
              Show security updates for packages in the system, including  all
              available Expanded Security Maintenance (ESM) related content.

              Shows counts of how many packages are supported for security up‐
              dates in the system.

              If  the  format is set to JSON or YAML it shows a summary of the
              installed packages based on the origin:

                  -  main/restricted/universe/multiverse:  Packages  from  the
              Ubuntu archive.
                  - esm-infra/esm-apps: Packages from the ESM archive.
                  - third-party: Packages installed from non-Ubuntu sources.
                  -  unknown: Packages which don't have an installation source
              (like local
                    deb packages or packages for  which  the  source  was  re‐
              moved).

              The  output  contains  basic information about Ubuntu Pro. For a
              complete status on Ubuntu Pro services, run 'pro status'.

       status [-h] [--wait] [--format {tabular,json,yaml}] [--simulate-with-
       token TOKEN] [--all]
              Report current status of Ubuntu Pro services on system.

              This shows whether this machine is attached  to  an  Ubuntu  Pro
              support  contract.  When  attached, the report includes the spe‐
              cific support contract details including contract  name,  expiry
              dates, and the status of each service on this system.

              The attached status output has four columns:

                  * SERVICE: Name of the service.
                  *  ENTITLED:  Whether  the contract to which this machine is
              attached
                    entitles use of this service. Possible values are: yes  or
              no.
                  *  STATUS:  Whether  the service is enabled on this machine.
              Possible
                    values are: enabled, disabled, n/a (if your contract enti‐
              tles
                    you to the service, but it isn't available  for  this  ma‐
              chine) or - (if
                    you aren't entitled to this service).
                  * DESCRIPTION: A brief description of the service.

              The  unattached status output instead has three columns. SERVICE
              and DESCRIPTION are the same as above, and there is the addition
              of:

                  * AVAILABLE: Whether this service would be available if this
              machine
                    were attached. The possible values are yes or no.

              If "simulate-with-token" is  used,  then  the  output  has  five
              columns.  SERVICE,  AVAILABLE,  ENTITLED and DESCRIPTION are the
              same as mentioned above, and AUTO_ENABLED shows whether the ser‐
              vice is set to be enabled when that token is attached.

              If the "all" flag is set, beta and unavailable services are also
              listed in the output.

       system [-h] {reboot-required} ...
              Output system-related information about Pro services.

           reboot-required [-h]
              Report the current reboot-required status for the machine.

              This command will output one of the three following  states  for
              the machine regarding reboot:

                  * no: The machine doesn't require a reboot.
                  * yes: The machine requires a reboot.
                  *  yes-kernel-livepatches-applied: There are only kernel-re‐
              lated
                    packages that require a reboot, but Livepatch has  already
              provided
                    patches  for the current running kernel. The machine still
              needs a
                    reboot, but you can assess if the reboot can be  performed
              in the
                    nearest maintenance window.

       Livepatch Service (livepatch)
              Livepatch  provides  selected high and critical kernel CVE fixes
              and  other  non-security  bug  fixes  as   kernel   livepatches.
              Livepatches  are applied without rebooting a machine which dras‐
              tically limits the need for unscheduled system reboots.  Due  to
              the  nature of fips compliance, livepatches cannot be enabled on
              fips-enabled systems.

       <job_name>_timer
              Sets the timer running interval for a specific job. Those inter‐
              vals are checked every time the systemd timer runs.

       apt_news
              If set to false, the Pro client will no longer display apt  news
              messages on the output of apt upgrade.

       apt_news_url
              Sets the url where the Pro client will consume apt news informa‐
              tion from.

       If  needed, authentication to the proxy server can be performed by set‐
       ting username and password in the URL itself, as in:
         http_proxy: http://<username>:<password>@<fqdn>:<port>

PRO UPGRADE DAEMON
       Ubuntu Pro client sets up a daemon on supported platforms (currently on
       Azure and GCP) to detect if an Ubuntu Pro license is purchased for  the
       machine.  If an Ubuntu Pro license is detected, then the machine is au‐
       tomatically attached.  If you are uninterested in Ubuntu Pro  services,
       you can safely stop and disable the daemon using systemctl:

       sudo  systemctl  stop  ubuntu-advantage.service  sudo systemctl disable
       ubuntu-advantage.service

TIMER JOBS
       Ubuntu Pro client sets up a systemd timer to run jobs that need  to  be
       executed  recurrently.  The timer itself ticks every 5 minutes on aver‐
       age, and decides which jobs need to be executed based on  their  inter‐
       vals.

       Jobs  are  executed  by  the timer script if the script has not yet run
       successfully, or their interval since last successful  run  is  already
       exceeded.   There is a random delay applied to the timer, to desynchro‐
       nize job execution time on machines spinned at the same time,  avoiding
       multiple synchronized calls to the same service.

       Current jobs being checked and executed are:

       update_messaging
              Makes  sure  that  the  MOTD  and  APT messages match the avail‐
              able/enabled services on the system, showing  information  about
              available packages or security updates.

       metering
              If  attached,  this  job will ping the Canonical servers telling
              which services are enabled on the machine.
