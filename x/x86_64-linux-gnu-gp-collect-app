GP-COLLECT-APP.1(1)              User Commands             GP-COLLECT-APP.1(1)

NAME
       gp-collect-app - Collect performance data for the target application

SYNOPSIS
       gprofng collect app [option(s)] target [target-option(s)]

DESCRIPTION
       Collect performance data on the target program.  In addition to Program
       Counter (PC) sampling, hardware event counters and various tracing
       options are supported.

       For example, this command collects performance data for an executable
       called a.out and stores the data collected in an experiment directory
       with the name example.er.

               $ gprofng collect app -o example.er ./a.out

OPTIONS
       --version
           Print the version number and exit.

       --help
           Print usage information and exit.

       -v, --verbose
           By default, verbose mode is disabled.  This option enables it.

       -p {off | on | lo[w] | hi[gh] | <value>}
           Disable  (off)  or  enable  (on)  clock  profiling  using a default
           sampling granularity,  or  enable  clock  profiling  implicitly  by
           setting  the  sampling  granularity  (lo[w],  hi[gh], or a specific
           value in ms).  By default, clock profiling is enabled (-p on).

       -h <ctr_def>[,<ctr_def>]
           Enable hardware event counter profiling  and  select  one  or  more
           counter(s).   To see the supported counters on this system, use the
           -h option without other arguments.

       -o <exp_name>
           Specify the name for the experiment directory.  The name has to end
           with   .er   and   may   contain    an    absolute    path    (e.g.
           /tmp/experiment.er).   An  existing  experiment  with the same name
           will not be overwritten.

       -O <exp_name>
           This is the same as the -o option, but unlike this option, silently
           overwrites an existing experiment directory with the same name.

       -C <comment_string>
           Add up to 10 comment strings to  the  experiment.   These  comments
           appear in the notes section of the header and can be retrieved with
           the gprofng display text command using the -header option.

       -j {on | off | <path>}
           Controls  Java  profiling  when  the  target is a JVM machine.  The
           allowed values for this option are:

           on  Record profiling  data  for  the  JVM  machine,  and  recognize
               methods  compiled  by  the  Java HotSpot virtual machine.  Also
               record Java call stacks.

           off Do not record Java profiling data.  Profiling data  for  native
               call stacks is still recorded.

           <path>
               Records  profiling  data  for  the  JVM,  and  use  the  JVM as
               installed in <path>.

           The default is -j on.

       -J <jvm-option(s)>
           Specifies one or more additional options to be passed  to  the  JVM
           used.   The  jvm-option(s) list must be enclosed in quotation marks
           if it contains more than one option.  The items in the list need to
           be separated by spaces or tabs.  Each item is passed as a  separate
           option to the JVM.  Note that this option implies -j on.

       -t <duration>[m|s]
           Collects  data  for  the specified duration.  The duration can be a
           single number, optionally followed by either m to specify  minutes,
           or s to specify seconds, which is the default.

           The  duration can also consists of two numbers separated by a minus
           (-) sign.  If a single number is given, data is collected from  the
           start  of  the run until the given time.  If two numbers are given,
           data is collected from the first time to the second.  In  case  the
           second  time  is  zero, data is collected until the end of the run.
           If two non-zero numbers are given, the first must be less than  the
           second.

       -n  This  is  used  for  a  dry  run.   Several  run-time  settings are
           displayed, but the target is not executed and no  performance  data
           is collected.

       -F {off|on|=regex}
           Control   whether  descendant  processes  should  have  their  data
           recorded.  To disable/enable this feature, use off/on.  Use  =regex
           to record data on those processes whose executable name matches the
           regular  expression.   Only the basename of the executable is used,
           not the full path.  If spaces  or  characters  interpreted  by  the
           shell are used, enclose the regex in single quotes.  The default is
           -F on.

       -a {off|on|ldobjects|src|usedldobjects|usedsrc}
           Specify  archiving  of  binaries  and  other files.  In addition to
           disable this feature (off), or enable archiving off all loadobjects
           and  sources  (on),  the  other  options  support  a  more  refined
           selection.

           All  of  these  options  enable archiving, but the keyword controls
           what exactly is selected: all load objects (ldobjects), all  source
           files  (src),  the  loadobjects  asscoiated  with a program counter
           (usedldobjects), or the source  files  associated  with  a  program
           counter (usedsrc).  The default is -a ldobjects.

       -S {off|on|<seconds>}
           Disable  (off),  or  enable  (on) periodic sampling of process-wide
           resource utilization.  By default, sampling  occurs  every  second.
           Use the <seconds> option to change this.  The default is -S on.

       -y <signal>[,r]
           Controls recording of data with the signal named <signal>, referred
           to  as  the  pause-resume  signal.   Whenever  the  given signal is
           delivered to  the  process,  switch  between  paused  (no  data  is
           recorded) and resumed (data is recorded) states.

           By  default,  data  collection  begins in the paused state.  If the
           optional r is given, data collection begins in  the  resumed  state
           and data collection begins immediately.

           SIGUSR1  or  SIGUSR2  are  recommended for this use, but any signal
           that is not used by the target can be used.

       -l <signal>
           Specify a  signal  that  will  trigger  a  sample  of  process-wide
           resource  utilization.  When the named <signal> is delivered to the
           process, a sample is recorded.

           The signal can be  specified  using  the  full  name,  without  the
           initial  letters  "SIG",  or the signal number.  Note that the kill
           command can be used to deliver a signal.

           If both the -l  and  -y  options  are  used,  the  signal  must  be
           different.

       -s <option>[,<API>]
           Enable  synchronization  wait  tracing,  where  <option> is used to
           define the specifics of the tracing (on, off, <threshold>, or all).
           The API is selected  through  the  setting  for  <API>:  n  selects
           native/Pthreads,  j selects Java, and nj selects both.  The default
           is -s off.

       -H {off|on}
           Disable (off), or enable (on) heap tracing.  The default is -H off.

       -i {off|on}
           Disable (off), or enable (on) I/O tracing.  The default is -i off.

NOTES
       Any executable in the  ELF  (Executable  and  Linkable  Format)  object
       format can be used for profiling with gprofng.  If debug information is
       available,  gprofng  can  provide  more  details,  but  this  is  not a
       requirement.
