xfs_bmap(8)                 System Manager's Manual                xfs_bmap(8)

NAME
       xfs_bmap - print block mapping for an XFS file

SYNOPSIS
       xfs_bmap [ -adelpv ] [ -n num_extents ] file
       xfs_bmap -V

DESCRIPTION
       xfs_bmap prints the map of disk blocks used by files in an XFS filesys‐
       tem.  The map lists each extent used by the file, as well as regions in
       the  file that do not have any corresponding blocks (holes).  Each line
       of the listings takes the following form:

              extent: [startoffset..endoffset]: startblock..endblock

       Holes are marked by replacing the startblock..endblock with hole.   All
       the  file  offsets  and disk blocks are in units of 512-byte blocks, no
       matter what the filesystem's block size is.

OPTIONS
       -a     If this option is specified, information about  the  file's  at‐
              tribute fork is printed instead of the default data fork.

       -e     If  this option is used, xfs_bmap obtains all delayed allocation
              extents, and does not flush dirty pages to disk before  querying
              extent  data.  With  the  -v  option, the flags column will show
              which extents have not yet been allocated.

       -l     If this option is used, then

                   <nblocks>  blocks

              will be appended to each line.  nblocks is the length of the ex‐
              tent described on the line in units of 512-byte blocks.

              This flag has no effect if the -v option is used.

       -n num_extents
              If this option is given, xfs_bmap will display at  most  num_ex‐
              tents  extents.  In the absence of -n, xfs_bmap will display all
              extents in the file.

       -p     If this option is used, xfs_bmap obtains all unwritten (preallo‐
              cated) extents that do not contain written data. With the -v op‐
              tion, the flags column will  show  which  extents  are  preallo‐
              cated/unwritten.

       -v     Shows  verbose  information.  When this flag is specified, addi‐
              tional AG specific information is appended to each line  in  the
              following form:

                   agno (startagoffset..endagoffset) nblocks flags

              A second -v option will print out the flags legend.

       -V     Prints the version number and exits.
